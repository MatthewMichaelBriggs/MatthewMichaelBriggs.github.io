                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm Matthew Briggs and I enjoy programming, maths and physics. I love to learn about these subjects and find all things related to these fields fascinating. I am currently studying a bachelor's degree in Videogame Design and Development at Universitat Jaume I in Castellón de la Plana, Spain. I also love to create projects and participate in events, like game jams.</p>
                    <p>Some of my hobbies include playing videogames and playing badminton. I also love to keep my mind active, reading books and watching videos and documentaries on a variety of subjects.</p>
                    <p>I am always willing to help someone understand something on a subject I know about. I have helped various people with their personal and academic projects, as well as tutoring them on some of my stronger subjects, like maths and programming.</p>

                    <h2>Education</h2>
                    <p>I am a second year student, studying a 4 year long bachelor's degree in Videogame Design and Development at Universitat Jaume I in Castellón de la Plana, Spain , it is based of the Computer Engineering bachelor's degree offered by the same university with a few changes to focus it more on videogames, like adding business and art subjects. I currently have an average grade of 8.67 out of 10 and I have received Excellent with Honours in 7 of the 15 subjects I have coursed, mostly in maths and programming subjects.

Another reason I decided to create this webpage was to gain web development skills.</p>

                                <p>A Game JAM is an event where you create a game with a specific theme in only 48 hours, this time the theme was phobia. Me and my team decided to create a 3d platformer to develop our 3d game making skills. I was in charge of the programming and did programmed the character movement, the camera movement and the platformer mechanics. I also created shaders and added al the 3d objects in to the game.</p>

As you can see from the following images I decided to recreate pacman emulating most of the features and ghost behaviors. I enjoyed this project because we had to create a videogame without an object oriented approach and learned a lot of things from the experience.</p>

For this reason instead of rushing the web page to complete it sooner and end up with a lower quality webpage, I have decided to update it when I have the time and even include links to some of the other projects and maybe even embed a gameplay video. I have many other projects I have created including 2 Game JAMs and a very ambitious game me and a team have created.</p>
